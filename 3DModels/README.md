3D models used
==============

Sensor enclosure is creation of Matthew Rogers and can be found here : 

[CYD Case ESP32 Desk or Wall Mountn](https://makerworld.com/en/models/668041#profileId-595642)

The 3mf project cannot be open directly with Prusa Slicer (this is my favourite slicer at the time)... 
It can be used with Bambu Studio.

I've uploaded as well the STL files for the case, the stand (you need two) and the snug bar.
